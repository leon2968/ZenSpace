            <h3 class="contentTitle"> What is Zen?</h3>
            <p>The word “Zen” is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese “Ch’an,” which means “meditation.” Ch’an came to Japan and became “Zen” around the eighth century. Today, the word “Zen” is in more general use in the West.</p>
            <p>Zen is not taken directly from the written word, nor religious transcriptions. It centers on a personal relationship with your own mind, and a higher, undefined entity outside of yourself. “Being Zen” is essentially a state of being at peace with your own thoughts, and being self-aware of your place within the universe.</p>

            <p>While our website is still in developlment phase, you can start practice Zen by yourself right now!</p>
            <p>Zen is the art of letting go, so naturally, a less cluttered home will help with peace of mind. A great way to be Zen at home is to make your own home more Zen by decluttering and cleaning. It might not sound fun, but cleaning and other simple chores are the backbone of spiritual training in Zen monasteries. Similar to the little ritual of making tea, some physical work also helps with clearing the mind.</p>
